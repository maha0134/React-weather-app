# React Weather App (Open Weather Student access expired so weather won't load)
<img src="/public/react-weather.png" align="left" width="500" alt="screenshot of react website">

A weather app created using `React.js` that uses **locationIQ API** to fetch coordinates and **Weather API** to fetch `current`, `hourly` and `daily weather` details for any searched location.

The website uses React Router to perform `Client side routing` to provide a very snappy user experience.

The website caches searched location coordinates so as to make less calls to the locationIQ API.
